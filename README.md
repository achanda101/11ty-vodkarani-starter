# 11ty-vodkarani-starter

A starter repository showing how to build a site with the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) site generator (using the [v2.0 release](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2/)).

Starter uses [OpenProps](https://open-props.style/) sub-atomic styles for standard web design tokens and consistent components.

Starter uses [Sanity Client](https://www.sanity.io/docs/js-client) to get content from the Sanity Data Lake. It uses v4.0.1 because the latest version (v6) has breaking changes. Please update the client at some point.
